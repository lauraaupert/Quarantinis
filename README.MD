#PROJECT OVERVIEW

By now, I think we can all agree that 2020 was a real cluster. Most of us held it together only with considerable help from adult beverages. Netflix, Instacart, and Franzia kept us from losing our minds while cooped up with hyperactive children, pandemic puppies, and partners we'd like some social distance from. As the contagion continued, sidewalks became social clubs. Day drinking on Zoom replaced gossiping at the water cooler so office workers could remain unproductive. And in cul-de-sacs across the country, driveway drinking helped parents avoid costly virtual visits to therapists and divorce attorneys. Thanks, alcohol!

We've designed an app to keep the party going. Chillax to some smooth tunes, and shelter in place with the perfect quarantini. Until inoculation is available, intoxication will have to do. So put on your best velour track suit, kick back in the La-Z-Boy, and raise your glass to the new year. It's 5 o'clock somewhere, and 2020 is over everywhere.
